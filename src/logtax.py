# Input: list of log files (perhaps only 2 for the prototype)
# Output: list of log classifications
# Process: First, assume log files are in JSON format, or are easily convertible to dictionary.
# For our example logs use the pre-existing scripts, but for other log examples,
# use a more basic process. After classify the log messages by a pre-determined list of log types
def multi_log_match(logs: list):
    results = []
    # step 1: data validation

    # step 2: process data

    # step 3: classify

    return results
